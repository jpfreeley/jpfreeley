Week 1 Project Overview
---------------------
The project this week was meant as an introduction to Python data analysis and visualization. It required me to:

*   create several different list and dictionary data structures
*   slice and select subsets of the full data set
*   perform simple descriptive statistics on the data
*   create graphs with MatPlotLib, Seaborn and Tableau to visualize the data
*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booze.
this:

+ Candy
+ Gum
+ Booze
and this:

-   Candy.
-   Gum.
-   Booze.

dog's back.
