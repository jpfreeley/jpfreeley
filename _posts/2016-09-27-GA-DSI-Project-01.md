Week 1 Project Overview
---------------------
The project this week was meant as an introduction to Python data analysis and visualization. It required me to:

*   create several different Python list [] and dictionary {} data structures
*   manipulate Python dictionaries using "list comprehensions", unpacking and "for loops"
*   slice and select subsets of the full data set
*   perform simple descriptive statistics on the data (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
*   create scatterplots, histograms, box plots and heatmaps with MatPlotLib, PyPlot, Seaborn and Tableau to visualize the data

**Note: The methodology below is drawn from the "Data Science Workflow" document provided by General Assembly**

### IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM

### ACQUIRE THE DATA

### PARSE THE DATA

### MINE THE DATA
