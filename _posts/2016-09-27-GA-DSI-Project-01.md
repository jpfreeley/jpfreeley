Week 1 Project Overview
---------------------
The project this week was meant as an introduction to Python data analysis and visualization. It required me to:

*   create several different Python list [] and dictionary {} data structures
*   manipulate Python dictionaries using "list comprehensions", unpacking and "for loops"
*   slice and select subsets of the full data set
*   perform simple descriptive statistics on the data (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation)
*   create scatterplots, histograms, box plots and heatmaps with MatPlotLib, PyPlot, Seaborn and Tableau to visualize the data

**Note: The methodology below is drawn from the "Data Science Workflow" document provided by General Assembly**

### IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM

### ACQUIRE THE DATA
The data as provided to us as a csv file.
"sat_scores.csv"
1 header row of the following values: *State, Rate, Verbal, Math*
*State* -- string, State of the testing
*Rate* -- float, percentage of participation for that 'state'
*Verbal* -- float, Average value of Verbal Score within that State
*Math* -- float, Average value of Math score within that State
*NOTE1:* there is also a 'summary' row denoted by "All" in the State column which represents the national averages
*NOTE2:* Washington, DC is treated as a "State"
### PARSE THE DATA

### MINE THE DATA

### REFINE THE DATA

### BUILD A DATA MODEL

### PRESENT RESULTS

### DEPLOY AND VALIDATE
