Week 1 Project Overview
---------------------
The project this week was meant as an introduction to Python data analysis and visualization. It required us to:
+ create several different list and dictionary data structures
+ slice and select subsets of the full data set
+ perform simple descriptive statistics on the data
+ create graphs with MatPlotLib, Seaborn and Tableau to visualize the data
